@imjustbucky : We are sending another $3B to Ukraine?Donâ€™t we need this for genome sequencing of MonkeyPox Delta Variant?#COVID19 #Covid #Ukraine 

@MiguelAlbion : @imjustbucky That's different money. The U.S. has lots of money. Enough to help Ukraine and help Americans. Our leaders just don't want to help Americans. 

@imjustbucky : @MiguelAlbion Only when it comes to student debt, I guess. ðŸ«¤
